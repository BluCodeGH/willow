# Willow
Willow is a work-in-progress programming language designed to be clean and flexible. Willow is statically typed, fully type inferenced, and functional-inspired; while it borrows many ideas from functional languages, mutability and side effects are still core features.

### Clean

Willow's syntax is designed to be minimalist. More specifically, redundancy should be avoided and Willow should be good at inference. This is not minimalism in terms of the amount of language features or the size of the standard library.

### Flexible

Willow should have a variety of deployment options. The first option to be implemented will be a basic interpreter, but future options include tranpilation and compilation, possibly using LLVM.
